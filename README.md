<h3>First Day</h3>

We created the first page in <strong>HTML</strong> styling in <strong>CSS</strong> where we practice the use of class, Id and responsiveness.

<h3>Second Day</h3>

We created the second page in <strong>HTML</strong>, where we can put into practice the creation of a good form, styling with <strong>CSS</strong>. It was a very exciting day, as we started the introduction to <strong>JavaScript</strong>, where we can learn more about the types of variables, conditionals, arrays, objects, loops, functions and put them into practice in the forms.
